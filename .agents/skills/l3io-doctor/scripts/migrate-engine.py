migrate-engine.py -- the eight-step migration run.

    detect -> read -> resolve -> plan -> GATE -> write -> verify -> dispose

The gate sits BEFORE the write, and that position is the whole point. The previous prose
migration ran its completeness checks AFTER writing and before deleting the source, so a
parse that produced zero nodes passed every check vacuously and then `rm -f`'d a live
BMad tracking file while reporting success. A gate placed before the write cannot do
that, whatever the cause of the empty parse -- including causes nobody has met yet.

Steps 1-4 are read-only and safe to run at any time. Steps 5-8 run only under --apply.

Usage:
  migrate-engine.py --artifacts DIR --project-root DIR --plan [--format json|text]
  migrate-engine.py --artifacts DIR --project-root DIR --apply --state-root DIR \\
                    --pm-status PATH [--dispose]
