# l3io-wp-config — local developer entry points.
#
# CI is replayed locally with nektos/act, configured by .actrc plus
# .act.{vars,env,secrets}. The same workflow files run here and on GitHub.
#
# First-time setup:
#   make act-init   copies .act.{vars,env,secrets}.example -> .act.{vars,env,secrets}
#
# Unlike the sibling repositories, `make ci` does NOT run under `infisical run`:
# ci.yml declares no secrets, because this package has no database, no registry
# step and no publish path in CI. publish.yml does need credentials, and act
# never runs it.
#
# Useful targets:
#   make lint         ruff check + format --check
#   make types        mypy --strict
#   make test         pytest
#   make contracts    the architecture gates (AD-27, AD-1, AD-2)
#   make check        lint + types + contracts + test, the whole local gate
#   make ci           replay the whole CI pipeline locally via act
#   make ci-job JOB=  replay one job, e.g. make ci-job JOB=contracts
#   make ci-dryrun    parse and plan the workflow without running it
#   make build        uv build --no-sources

ACT_FILES := .act.vars .act.env .act.secrets
UV := uv

# ~/.actrc declares shared publish and registry credentials as bare `-s NAME`
# for the sibling repositories. act prompts for any it cannot resolve and then
# fails outside a TTY, which blocks local replay entirely. ci.yml here uses none
# of them -- this package has no database, no registry step and no publish path
# in CI -- so they are resolved to an obvious placeholder.
#
# The placeholder must be NON-EMPTY: act treats an empty environment value as
# unset and prompts anyway, then fails outside a TTY. `--secret-file` does not
# satisfy a bare `-s NAME` declaration at all; only the environment does.
#
# GITHUB_TOKEN is excluded deliberately: act does not prompt for it when absent,
# and a PLACEHOLDER value is worse than none -- act hands it to git when fetching
# actions, and GitHub rejects it, so action resolution fails. Absent means an
# anonymous clone, which is what these public actions need.
#
# The list is read from ~/.actrc rather than written out here, so it cannot
# drift from what act actually declares.
#
# publish.yml is the one place these matter, and act never runs it (see .actrc).
# Supply them through `infisical run` when that changes.

# Validating the workflows act CANNOT execute
#
# `make ci` runs ci.yml for real. publish.yml and release.yml are deliberately
# outside it -- act has no OIDC and ignores job.permissions, so running them
# locally would be misleading at best, and release.yml CREATES TAGS and dispatches
# publishes, which must never happen from a laptop.
#
# A dry run is the middle ground and it is worth more than it looks. act resolves
# every `uses:` ref against the remote before deciding to skip the step, so a
# dryrun fails on an action version that does not exist -- it is what catches
# `changelog-parser@v3.0.14`, a real version of a DIFFERENT action, which no
# amount of YAML validation would have found. It also catches expression syntax
# errors, unknown contexts and missing `needs`.
#
# --dryrun IS LOAD-BEARING, not a nicety. Without it this target cuts real tags
# and fires real publishes. A contract test asserts every workflow named here is
# run with it, so removing it fails `make check` rather than surprising someone.

# contract asserts they reach every job in every workflow -- and it can only do
# that if both read the same declaration. Hand-listing them in the recipe would

#
# ci.yml is NOT dry-run: `make ci` runs it for real, and act SEGFAULTS dry-running
# it (nil pointer in containerReference.GetHealth) because it declares MySQL
# service containers that a dry run never starts. An act limitation, not a defect
