"""
pm-status.py — deterministic, atomic, round-trip-safe writer for the l3io-pm
sharded state tree, and the reader behind its progress report.

Why this exists
---------------
Status transitions used to be free-form YAML edits the model performed between
phases. Under load or parallel execution those edits were skipped, malformed, or
they reordered/stripped the file. This script makes every transition a single
deterministic operation:

  * node addressing follows references/status-files.md (epic -> sprints -> stories),
  * writes are atomic (temp file + os.replace) so a crash never leaves a partial file,
  * ruamel round-trip load/dump preserves key order and comments so diffs stay clean,
  * `verify` is a hard read-back gate the orchestrator can branch on (exit code).

BMad standardizes on `uv run`; the PEP-723 header above lets `uv` provision
ruamel.yaml automatically. Always invoke via `uv run pm-status.py ...` — running
under `python3` directly bypasses the provisioning and fails with
ModuleNotFoundError anywhere ruamel.yaml is not already installed globally.

    raw `actual / estimate` (or `actual x fix / estimate`) measures error against
    an estimate that already contains the previous ratio. Feeding that back as
    the next ratio makes the loop converge to sqrt(truth / band_mid) — a
    permanent underestimate no volume of data closes — and means a perfect
    estimate never produces a neutral sample. Dividing the applied ratio back
    out fixes both:

      exact   (fix_iterations == 0, the actual is pure scope):
          sample = actual x scope_ratio_applied x fix_factor / estimate
                 = actual / band_mid
      backout (rework present or unknown — the actual mixes scope and rework):
          scope portion is actual / fix_factor, so the fix factor cancels:
          sample = actual x scope_ratio_applied / estimate
                 = actual / (band_mid x fix_factor)
      legacy  (estimate predates the recorded factors): both default to 1.0,
          sample = actual / estimate, labelled `legacy` so an audit can tell
          the imprecision apart.

    """Closure overhead = parent actual - sum(children actuals). Returns (sample, reason).

    THE RATIO'S DENOMINATOR MUST BE THE QUANTITY THE RATIO IS APPLIED TO.
    `estimate-rollup` applies the learned ratio to the CLOSURE BAND alone
    (`total x (1 + ratio x closure_band + fraction x ORCH_SPREAD)`), so the
    residual has to be divided by the ESTIMATED CLOSURE OVERHEAD ALONE, never
    by the whole parent estimate and never by closure-plus-orchestration.
    Dividing by the whole parent made learn and apply different quantities,
    and a perfectly consistent history moved the estimate AWAY from its own
    observed truth.

    THE ORCHESTRATION BAND IS NOT PART OF THIS DENOMINATOR. Since the
    orchestration term joined the roll-up, `pmid - sum(child estimates)` is
    the closure band PLUS the orchestration band, while the residual it
    divides (`parent actual - sum(children actual)`) is closure-only —
    orchestration lives in its own `orchestration` block, outside `actual`.
    Leaving the orchestration band in the denominator understated every
    closure sample by exactly the factor the two bands differ by (with an
    active fraction of 0.5 and children summing to 20, a true overhead of 5
    recorded as 0.3704 instead of 1.4286 — 3.9x low, and worse as the
    fraction grows). So the applied fraction (`estimate.orchestration_ratios`,
    the same divide-it-back-out record `closure_ratios` and `scope_ratios`
    are) is subtracted back off at its band MIDPOINT (`ORCH_MID`), leaving
    exactly `est_total x closure_ratio_applied x mid(COLD_START_CLOSURE_BAND)`
    — the quantity the closure ratio is applied to and nothing else.

    And, as with the story scope ratio, the estimated overhead already contains
    the ratio that was applied when the parent estimate was written, so that
    ratio is divided back out (`closure_ratios` on the estimate block, 1.0 when
    absent). Without it the loop settles on a geometric mean instead of the
    truth. Concretely: children estimated 40, closure overhead truly 8 every
    time. Estimated overhead cold-start = 47 - 40 = 7, sample 8/7 = 1.143, and
    `40 x (1 + 1.143 x 0.175) = 48.0` — the observed total, and stable on every
    later generation because the applied ratio cancels.

    Guards, each skipping just THAT METRIC with a reason rather than aborting
    the whole sample: any child missing that metric's actual (a partial sum
    understates overhead and biases the ratio low, permanently); a negative
    residual (a miscount — except for wall-clock, where parallel execution makes
    it expected); a ZERO residual (see below); an estimated overhead <= 0
    (nothing to measure against); and N/A tokens, which skips just that metric
    while man-hours still record under non-Claude runtimes where tokens are
    legitimately absent.

    A ZERO RESIDUAL IS A SKIP, NOT A SAMPLE OF 0.0 — and "zero" means within a
    relative tolerance, on both signs, not exactly 0.0 in binary. A parent actual
    equal to the sum of its children means the closure phases' own spend
    (adversarial analysis, retrospective, QA generation — real, measurable
    work) was attributed to nothing. Recording that as a legitimate 0.0
    sample is worse than recording nothing: 0.0 is not None, so after three
    such sprints `active_closure_ratio` returns 0.0, `cmd_estimate_rollup`
    accepts it, and the closure band contributes nothing to any future
    estimate — permanently, with no marker saying why. The step files now
    instruct the parent actual as "sum of children PLUS this level's own
    closure-phase spend" precisely so this does not arise; when it does, it
    is a capture defect and must be reported as one, not learned from. Both
    signs route to that one reason because a bare sum over decimal inputs lands
    on either side of zero depending on the values (0.3 + 0.6 vs 0.9 leaves
    +1.11e-16; 1.1 + 2.2 vs 3.3 leaves -4.44e-16), and calling the second a
    "miscount" would tell the reader something false.

    Iterates CALIBRATED_METRIC_FIELDS, not CLOSURE_RANGE_KEYS or the full
    METRIC_FIELDS: `cost` never produces a closure sample (Task 10) — it is
    derived from the rolled-up tokens_k range at estimate-rollup time, so a
    residual measured against its own band would have nothing left to divide
    against and nothing calibrating it downstream would ever read the sample.

    THE FRACTION, NOT A RATIO. Every other component here (scope, closure)
    learns a ratio — actual over an ESTIMATE, correcting a number that
    already exists. Orchestration has nothing to correct: the band ships
    `null` by design, because every number available when this was built was
    contaminated by an operational defect (roughly thirty blocking waits each
    outlived the prompt cache and re-created a ~93k-token prefix), and sizing
    a prior on that would commit the bug to every future estimate. So there
    is no estimate to divide by, and a ratio-based component could never
    bootstrap — it would need the very thing it doesn't have. Instead the
    sample IS the band: orchestration_actual / sum(children actual), directly
    observable from the first closed sprint or epic. Do not "fix" this into a
    ratio for consistency with closure — that would remove the one thing
    that lets it start learning at all.

    THE DENOMINATOR MUST BE COMPLETE, per metric, the same guard
    derive_closure_sample applies to its residual: if any child that exists
    is missing that metric's actual, the sum silently understates the true
    total and the fraction is inflated — a wrong number that looks right, and
    permanently so once it feeds calibration. So a metric is sampled only
    when EVERY child carries a numeric actual for it; a partial sum is
    treated as no sample, not as a smaller one.

    `cost` is deliberately absent from CALIBRATED_METRIC_FIELDS: it is
    derived from tokens x rates, so its fraction is already implied by the
    tokens_k fraction and a second, independently-drifting copy would add
    nothing but disagreement.

    REPLAY-GUARDED, like every other record_*_sample here: a second
    `set-actual --block orchestration` on the same node (a retry, a
    corrected number, a replayed closure step) must not append a second
    sample and skew the learned fraction with nothing on disk to explain it.
    Gated on its own ORCHESTRATION_MARKER rather than the closure/story
    CALIBRATION_MARKER, because a sprint or epic node carries both an
    actual/closure sample and an orchestration sample — one marker would let
    whichever writes first silently suppress the other. `_closure_nodes`
    resolves the same parent path for both sprint and epic level, so this
    one guard covers both without a level-specific branch.

`cache_read` is deliberately absent. It is a function of corpus size times agent
count -- how much context each dispatched agent re-reads -- not of how much work
the story asks for. A story that touches one file in a large repo reads the same
corpus as one that touches ten. Folding it into the scope basis made the ratio
measure the repo, not the story.

This is not theoretical. BASE_BANDS' tokens_k numbers (20-200k) were authored as
fresh-token bands, but actuals are captured cache-inclusive: one observed story
measured 182,121k with 97.4% of it cache reads. Dividing a cache-inclusive actual
by a fresh-scale band gave a scope ratio absorbing a ~1000x basis gap in silence,
and the per-class evidence is unambiguous about it being a basis error rather
than a real signal -- the complex bucket read 285.291 across five samples that
straddled the accounting change, while standard read 7.386 across three that did
not. Only the poisoned bucket moved.

cache_read is still captured, still priced, and still rolled up. It is simply not
what `scope` learns from; it belongs to the orchestration term, which is measured
as a fraction of children rather than predicted from a band.

    The closure band scales by the calibrated closure ratio for level/metric

    ratio 1.0). The orchestration band scales by the calibrated orchestration
    FRACTION for level/metric once active, else it contributes nothing — there

    The applied ratios/fractions are recorded as `estimate.closure_ratios` and
    `estimate.orchestration_ratios`, per metric, so `derive_closure_sample` and
    a future orchestration-sample reader can divide them back out — the same
    reason `estimate.scope_ratios` exists on a story.

    `cost` is not one of the banded metrics (see CLOSURE_RANGE_KEYS): it is
    derived from the rolled-up tokens_k range, split across classes by
    `observed_mix`, then priced for `--model` (falling back to
    DEFAULT_ESTIMATE_MODEL) — the sprint/epic-level mirror of what
    `cmd_estimate_story` already does for a story. This keeps the rolled-up
    cost arithmetically bound to the rolled-up token estimate it prices,
    instead of banding and calibrating a second, independently-drifting cost.

    Never exits: raises PMError(3) for a missing parent, PMError(2) for
    nothing to roll up or an unpriceable model.

    The epic-level roll-up rewrites epic.yaml, so it runs under that epic's
    epic_node_lock -- re-entrantly when promote-issue, which already holds it,
    is the caller. An epic the pre-check cannot find raises PMError(3) right
    there, with no lock file created for it. It is never handed to the body
    unlocked: find_epic_dir scans active -> planned -> archived, so a move-epic
    the other way can land mid-scan and hide an epic that exists, and the body's
    own re-resolve would then find it and reach save_node without the lock.

    "read the usage fields".

    That instruction was not executable, and an agent asked to follow it by hand hit
    every trap below at once. Two of them inflate and one deflates, so the wrong answer
    came out plausible rather than obviously broken: the errors partly cancel.
    Each is handled here, and each is a property of the real file format, verified
    against a 2,482-record transcript rather than assumed:

    1. INFLATES -- **the same API call appears many times.** Assistant records are
       written repeatedly as a message streams and is revised, carrying an identical
       `message.id` and identical `usage` each time. The sample held 2,482 assistant
       records for 953 distinct ids: summing records rather than ids overstates by
       roughly 2.6x. Deduplicated here by `message.id`, keeping the first occurrence.

    2. INFLATES -- **cache creation is reported twice, two ways.** `usage` carries both
       the flat `cache_creation_input_tokens` and a nested `cache_creation` mapping of
       `ephemeral_5m/1h` counts. They are the same tokens: the nested values summed
       equalled the flat field in 2,482 of 2,482 records. Adding both double-counts the
       most expensive class. Only the flat field is read.

    3. DEFLATES -- **subagent turns are easy to miss.** Work dispatched to a subagent is
       recorded with `isSidechain: true`, and often in a different file entirely. Reading
       one file, or filtering sidechains out, silently drops whole phases -- which is the
       deflating half that made the net error look small. Sidechain records are counted,
       and `paths` accepts directories so a run split across files is summed whole.

    Returns the four class totals plus counts that let a caller sanity-check the read.

    Every path handed to `git mv` is absolutized first, and so is its `cwd`. A relative
    `state_root` would otherwise be resolved twice — once by the caller's process cwd when
    the operands were built, and again by `cwd=state_root` inside the subprocess — so git

    `git mv` is the entire reason this function moves directories instead of collapsing
    them, so that degradation must not be silent: the fallback now warns on stderr.

    The move and the epic.yaml status write run under the epic's epic_node_lock. Its lock
    file lives outside the directory being moved (epic_lock_path), so the move cannot carry
    it away from a waiter; every waiter resolves the epic again once it holds the lock, and
