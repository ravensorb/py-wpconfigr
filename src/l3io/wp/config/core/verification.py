"""
Read-back verification over rendered text (ADR-0010).

Pure. The comparison is on the rendered ``define()`` text, never on values
round-tripped through ``get()``: the parser deliberately does not round-trip
every literal, so a value comparison reports a mismatch for correct input -- an
all-digit password being the ordinary case.
