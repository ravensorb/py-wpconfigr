"""
Package-owned error hierarchy (AD-14).

No stdlib or dependency exception type crosses this package's public boundary.
Failures at a boundary are caught and re-raised as one of these, with
``raise ... from`` preserving the cause. Every error carries structured fields
rather than only a formatted message, and no message contains a credential --
values are identified by key, never quoted back.
